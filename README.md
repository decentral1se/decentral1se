I'm currently hacking on [hyperpy](https://github.com/hyperpy), a Python implementation of the [Hypercore protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org/). Other softwares I've had a hand in making are [calibrestekje](https://github.com/decentral1se/calibrestekje), [etherpump](https://git.vvvvvvaria.org/varia/etherpump), [molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule/) and [molecule-hetznercloud](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-hetznercloud). You can support my free software work through [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/decentral1se) or [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/decentral1se).

I'm based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, working part-time with [Autonomic]() and I'm a member of [Varia](https://varia.zone/) and [Biobulkbende](https://biobulkbende.org/). You can find out more on [my homepage](https://decentral1.se).
